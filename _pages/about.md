I'm a research assistant from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), under the supervision of Professor Aiman Soliman. I am also a research intern at IDEA Lab@UIUC supervised by Professor Hanghang Tong, working on graph mining and network alignment. Prior to this, I received my master's degree in Computer Science from UIUC, and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dalian University of Technology, China. My research interests lie in machine learning and graph mining.
