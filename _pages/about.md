I'm a research assistant at IDEA Lab@UIUC led by Professor [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org), working on graph mining and network alignment. Prior to this, I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn), China. My research interests lie in machine learning and graph mining.
